                <p>
                    When we participate in Art, Paintings ,Drawing it can play an emotional game in our minds
                    and we
                    most
                    times see a need to repress the feelings that have risen and we tend to want to get rid of
                    the
                    feelings
                    any way we can. My art reflects a great deal of my early years of wanting and embracing
                    freedom
                    to
                    see
                    the sky and the space around me and to see myself as wanting to be free always to do the
                    things
                    I
                    love
                    and to embrace freedom ,love and nature. To adapt to the changes in life and that others
                    will be
                    able to
                    see themselves in my growth and aspiration in doing the things that bring joy to their lives
                    and
                    the
                    lives of others.
                </p>


                <p>
                    When you see my art and my collection , I am trusting that you will feel your best and will
                    want
                    to
                    have
                    one of my paintings hanging on your wall to inspire and direct you to make changes in your
                    own
                    lives
                    to
                    act and to do the things you love. No one can take action for you but you. You can seek
                    help,
                    professional help or you can seek your own help if you are also moving in a spiritual
                    journey of
                    growth.I am learning to align myself , my mind, my heart, my soul and my strength with my
                    spirit. My
                    art
                    has helped me to do this and it gets easier everyday.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I am glad that I have started this journey now.

                <h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>

                <p>

                    This collection took me three years to compile. It was inspirational and allowed me to
                    grow
                    in a way that I love myself and my achievements in my life even more.

                    My family gave me the needed support to persevere and make things that appear
                    overwhelming
                    became easily manageable and doable. I learnt to put things, my emotions and my mind in
                    places
                    of joy and peace.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The action allowed me to heighten my senses allowing me to see colors and light in a
                    different
                    way.My
                    children inspired me to make this group of paintings and think of myself and look into
                    myself so
                    that I
                    can do the things that I love and bring this beautiful collection to fruition.For this, I
                    thank
                    all those who have helped me bring this collection to fruition.

                    has
